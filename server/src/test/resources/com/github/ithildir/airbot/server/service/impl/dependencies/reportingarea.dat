For Sunday, the front moves offshore and skies clear, temperatures rise, humidity drops, and ozone production will have a green light to increase. Luckily, the "clean out" from the rain and the front pushing pollutants away from the area today will mean ozone starts from a clean slate. Thus, all regions should remain CODE GREEN for Sunday.|South Carolina DHEC

Right now, we are seeing winds reside out of the southeast, allowing for temperatures to rise into the 50s.  The combination of the cloud cover and cool temperatures are limiting ozone formation to the good category.  Expect good air quality to persist through the weekend as we begin to transition to a different weather pattern. *** The Weekend Forecast: On Saturday, expect the clouds to persist as the storm system, which was off to our southwest on Friday, moves northeastward through eastern PA.  The winds will rotate counterclockwise around storm system, forcing our winds to turn out of the north during the day.  As a result, we should continue to see cool air advect into our area.  High temperatures will peak in the upper 50s to near 60 with ozone levels in the good range.  On Sunday, we should see the sun begin to return over our area as the storm system, which was off to our east on Saturday, tracks northward into New England.  Winds around this storm will keep our flow out of the north.  The northerly flow will allow drier air to build in while the peaks of sunshine will allow temperatures to climb into the 60s.  Ozone should stay confined to the good category.  By Monday, higher pressure will begin to build in, creating more sunshine and warmer temperatures.  This increase in sunshine will not only allow high temperatures to peak well into the 60s but should also force ozone closer to the moderate threshold. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

05/12/17|05/14/17||EDT|2|F|Y|Ann Arbor|MI|42.2754|-83.7308|OZONE||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, May 8th, 2017 through Monday, May 15th, 2017  Ozone: Ozone concentrations are expected to be Good throughout the forecast period.   PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are also expected to be Good to Low Moderate throughout the forecast period.   FORECAST DISCUSSION:   The forecast period will be drier than the previous week with moderating temperatures by the end of the week.   Colder than normal temperatures prevailed through the weekend as we were under a northerly wind flow providing Good Air Quality.   Unlike last couple of weeks with heavy rains and cooler temperatures, this week will be mostly dry with a return to seasonal temperatures in the mid-60’s.   This work week begins under high pressure and light winds. Continued northerly flow will keep temperatures on the cooler side and many areas of the state will be under a frost/freeze advisories Monday night. A period of pleasant weather and warming temperatures will continue through the work week with a slight chance of showers Wednesday night.   We will not see any periods of persistent winds from the southwest sectors for the until late in the weekend. The mix of northerly and easterly winds should keep our Air Quality mostly Good during that time.

The Apache Junction ozone levels surpassed the health based standard. Unfortunately more of the same is expected today so as a precaution have issued a same day ozone health watch. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities this afternoon/early evening when the ozone levels will be at the highest. The good news from the ozone perspective will be the exit of the high pressure which will be replaced by a large trough over the western United States over the next several days. The large trough along with several imbedded pulses of energy which will rotate around the large area of low pressure will skirt by the state this weekend and result in breezy conditions which typically inhibit ozone formation. However some localized blowing dust is possible and is reflected in the elevated PM10 forecast. More in the way of wind is expected next week with the middle of the week looking prime for strong gusty winds and more widespread blowing dust.

05/12/17|05/14/17||EDT|2|F|Y|Benton Harbor|MI|42.1167|-86.4542|OZONE||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, May 8th, 2017 through Monday, May 15th, 2017  Ozone: Ozone concentrations are expected to be Good throughout the forecast period.   PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations are also expected to be Good to Low Moderate throughout the forecast period.   FORECAST DISCUSSION:   The forecast period will be drier than the previous week with moderating temperatures by the end of the week.   Colder than normal temperatures prevailed through the weekend as we were under a northerly wind flow providing Good Air Quality.   Unlike last couple of weeks with heavy rains and cooler temperatures, this week will be mostly dry with a return to seasonal temperatures in the mid-60’s.   This work week begins under high pressure and light winds. Continued northerly flow will keep temperatures on the cooler side and many areas of the state will be under a frost/freeze advisories Monday night. A period of pleasant weather and warming temperatures will continue through the work week with a slight chance of showers Wednesday night.   We will not see any periods of persistent winds from the southwest sectors for the until late in the weekend. The mix of northerly and easterly winds should keep our Air Quality mostly Good during that time.   EXTENDED FORECAST:   Air Quality is expected to be Good to Moderate going into the next work week.
